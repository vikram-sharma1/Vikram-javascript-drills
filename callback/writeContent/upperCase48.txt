the villagers of little hangleron still called it "the riddle house," even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there
 it stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face
 once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the riddle house was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied
the little hagletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy"
 half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce
the story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore
 every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead
the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could
"lying there with their eyes wide open! cold as ice! still in their dinner things!"the police were summoned, and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement
 nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles, for they had been most unpopular
 elderly mr
 and mrs
riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, tom, had been, if anything, worse
 all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night
